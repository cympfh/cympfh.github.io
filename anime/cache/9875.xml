<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="459461">History repeats itself, it was again over the max top last episode.
It is true that this series exaggerate everything into maximum heights and characters are always yelling at each other but the artwork is great, music is magnifique and characters are all very likeable.
What a great ride it was, thanks Trigger.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="333426">Despite the style, the animation quality is very high.
Although the story is slightly dragged on,it never gets boring due to its pace.
Sound and music is excellent,although certain tracks are perhaps overused.
From the start GAINAX vibes are apparent , as in many ways it is similar to Gurren Lagan and FLCL.
Overall a refreshing series,definitely worth watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="469237">What should I say for this one?I really can`t describe the series, but I definetely can describe my feelings. At the first episodes (until 6-7 I think) the series kept me wondering why I`m still watching this crap..! But it kept me interested, while my laughs where heard across my neighborhood at most times. After that number of episodes, the series managed to keep me interested with its plot (?) too, and then the fun begun. Reccomended if you want to watch something... different.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="330647">Having just completed this series, I honestly do not have the slightest idea what to say about it. Speaking with hard numbers, I gave it an 8 out of 10, but if I were to use words...

I don`t have the slightest idea what was that I just watched. I mean - it was oddly addicting, completely nonsensical in a very amusing way. It took a good deal of my sanity to enjoy this, but enjoy it I did.

I once read that "whatever is, is alive". And Kill la Kill is. It is, in its very own nonsensical kind of way. It`s not for everyone, but it`s hilariously over the top to a degree that it is enjoyable as hell to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="378701">At first I thought the plot was too weak but it does evolve and become more interesting as the true plot is unveiled (not that it`s complex anyway but at least it`s not silly). As an action series, it`s quite a good one and it certainly keeps you entertained.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="53340">If you like  go nagai anime style... this is  absolutelly for you!

very recomended...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="172963">This is one hell of a ride! It`s plot is ridiculous, but the show stays true to it until the end! It`s like Ren &amp; Stimpy, but with a story. I was impressed. "Over the top" - Kill La Kill deserves this description.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="97219">If you like the old Gainax style from FLCL and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann this one is definitely a must-see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="331735">WTF.

Three letters are enough to say what to expect from this anime. It is not for anyone, yet if you accept the challenge of lulz and badassery, welcome to Trigger. Yes, there is fanservice, but with a trully unique spin.

Go ahead... if you dare!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="357099">A hilarious anime swelling with comedy and action. In this show high school/everyday themes get`s mixed with overhyped scenes of fighting and absolute destruction.
I`ll highly recommend Kill la Kill for anyone who needs to spice up their mood with some raw action and a good laugh. This type of anime might not be appealing to everyone though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="172236">At ep12 it`s just pure pleasure to watch. Wacky, over the top, while still holding story worthy of attention - all the while twisting common anime tropes in most witty ways possible.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="346924">Totally insane.
I loved it. 
Easily 8.5/10!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="387494">This is going to be one and only recommendation I ever give. 

No matter what genre you are a fan off, this is must see.

It has it all.

Comedy. Wackiness. Parody of anime tropes. OVER 9000 EPICNESS. EPIC ARMORS. EPIC WEAPONS. Blood. Gore. A decent, serious plotline (wait till the latter episodes and start biting your nails). Twists. Cliffhangers that make you shake for a week waiting for the next episode. Soundtrack that reaches to your soul. Half-nude girls and some serious lesbian incest, but that`s for fans.  Also, half-nude guys with strategically places purple light curtains, but again, that`s for fans. It`s like Gurren Lagenn perfected. Just the right ammount of everything.

Can`t wait for the series to come to the finale, and dread that moment at the same time. This quality of work comes along once in a lifetime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="537611">If any of you are a fan of older anime such as Outlaw Star, Project A-ko, Cutey Honey or just missed when anime used to be crazy ass fun then KLK is for you. Does this save anime? No, but it is sure a reminder that anime can be awesome still. It sure as hell is fun to watch. Trigger is becoming the Platinum (an awesome video game company) of the anime industry.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="547633">I can`t even begin to tell you why you need to watch this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="407601">Let it be said that in all the anime I watched (and registered on anidb), it`s the first I`ll write a rec for. And I have but one word: EPIC.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="618709">this is my first recommendation and it`s well deserved. I can`t explain how much this anime entertained me. The ecchi might make it a bit difficult to watch just anywhere, but to be honest, it`s totally acceptably and professionally implemented. extremely funny, and with epic story, this is none anime you NEED to watch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="591695">When my friend first recommended it to me, I was put off by the animation at first. But I decided to give a go anyway. Why not? 

What happened afterwards was beyond words. Everything was over the top, ost, animation, story, characters... I loved it so much, it is so incomprehensible that makes it a joy to watch. This is definitely a must see this year!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="226356">The animation style at first made me avoid the series, but after 2 episodes I found it rather enjoyable. It has a great soundtrack and the plot was quite interesting.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="77536">a crazy anime, just the way you like it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="410747">Rather original anime with good typography and graphic style</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="48145">It`s a wild, crazy and sexy action/comedy epic that`s akin to a visual rollercoaster. You owe it to yourself to give this a try.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="194756">"wow. this show can`t get any more insane"
^ Repeat after every episode for 24 episodes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="167">if this doesn`t get your blood boiling then you are probably dead.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="6744">Subtitles get in the way of the splendor :)
For an oldie like me, this is one of the few i recommend a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="384413">One of the most amazing and epic spectacles you can watch. Awesome soundtrack, likeable characters, enjoyable story, creative, and an extravaganza of epic as fuck action!

Must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="422859">The staff who worked on Gurren Lagann are back for Kill La Kill and they don`t disappoint.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="577148">if u wanna see something unusual but awsome watch this!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="67247">From the creators of Gurren Lagann... comes another show that`s just as crazy awesome, if not more. The anime is a throwback to older 80`s/90`s anime and is filled with many clever references. The animation is unique, the soundtrack is great, and the story is quite interesting (and weird) so far. If you`re a long-time anime fan, you should enjoy this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="9782">Take everything good about shounen anime (DBZ, Naruto, etc), liberally add comedy/parody from anime like Project A-KO, tie it all together with a cohesive (if bizarre) plot and non-stop-never-give-you-a-chance-to-catch-your-breath action...and you get "Kill la Kill".</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="179096">Anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="390345">best show of the past decade. just watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="620621">I can`t think of a single reason not to watch this. 10 out of 10 hands down</recommendation>

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Japanese for "transformation" (metamorphosis or disguise).
A "henshin anime" is any anime, where the characters or their costumes transform, such as Sailor Moon. The henshin switches on the character`s special powers, and is frequently accompanied by a costume change. Often the change of clothing is the only outward indicator that the character has changed and yet nobody seems to notice the hero`s true self.
Most henshin heroes have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase (which is often in Engrish, for some reason), triggering a transformation sequence.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

Normally, tags don`t refer to physical translations of text, subtitle appearances and karaoke styling added by 3rd parties. But those who seek to describe an anime that is heavy on SPOKEN dialogue (which may tend to create a large quantity of natural subtitling to read for those not fluent in the language being used) could consider this tag but may make clearer reference with the dialogue driven tag.</description>

<name>absurdly powerful student council</name>
<description>A student council is a student-managed body inside a school which engages in administrative affairs, usually usually working in a partnership with management, staff and parents, for the benefit of the whole school environment. In real life, a student council holds no actual power; however, in many anime/manga, they have an insane amount of power, which usually allows them to overrule nearly everyone else (the school board, the mayor, the prime minster, you name it). In those cases, that device is explored as a major source of slapstick comedy.</description>

<name>torture</name>
<description>Torture involves the deliberate act of inflicting pain, to either fulfill a desire of the torturer, or apply coercion to compel action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.
This is distinct from http://anidb.net/t2905 [erotic torture], which is generally for the purpose of using (almost) any form of physical or excessive psychological abuse to inflict physical and/or mental pain, with the goal of inducing sexual pleasure.</description>

<summary>Ryuko Matoi transfers into Honnouji Academy, a high school dominated by its fearsome student council, who wear powerful Goku Uniforms that grant them superhuman abilities. Searching for clues to her father`s murder, Ryuko confronts the student council president, Satsuki Kiryuin, saying she is looking for the owner of the other half of a giant scissor blade she wields. She is easily beaten by the school`s boxing club captain, Takaharu Fukuroda, using the power of his Two-Star Goku Uniform. Fleeing to her ruined home nearby, Ryuko is dropped down a trapdoor by her homeroom teacher, Aikuro Mikisugi. She lands in a basement and discovers a living sailor uniform that forcibly puts itself on her. The next day, Takaharu prepares to sentence Ryuko`s friendly classmate Mako Mankanshoku to death for treason. Ryuko arrives to rescue her and confront Takaharu again, this time using her new uniform`s powers to defeat him and destroy his Goku Uniform. Afterwards, Ryuko questions Satsuki again about the wielder of the other scissor blade, who is allegedly the one who killed her father.</summary>

<summary>Ryuko is fatigued after her battle and flees, passing out and ending up in the care of Mako`s family. That night, Ryuko recalls how she was introduced to the uniform, which she decides to name Senketsu, who was created by her father, Isshin. The next day, Ryuko comes across the tennis club captain, Omiko Hakodate, who knocks her away when Senketsu fails to activate. She is found by Aikuro, who explains Senketsu is a Kamui that requires her blood to operate, providing her with a glove to help her in this regard. He offers to provide more information about Senketsu in exchange for Omiko`s defeat. Ryuko goes to face Omiko which, after some interference from Mako, results in a tennis match between the two. Ryuko gets off to a rough start, but eventually manages to fight back with her scissor blade and destroy Omiko`s Goku Uniform, winning the match on a technicality. Afterwards, Satsuki herself appears before Ryuko to challenge her to a fight, but due to lack of blood remaining she flees.</summary>

<summary>Hearing about how many students have been starting their own clubs to become eligible to get better uniforms, and thus better living rights, Ryuko decides to start her own Fight Club, assigning Mako as the club president to handle all the paperwork and meetings. As Ryuko increases the club`s reputation by defeating other club presidents, Mako manages to earn a One-Star Goku Uniform, upgrading the Mankanshoku family to a better apartment. Mako`s determination to preserve her family`s newfound happiness moves the family up to an even more luxurious lifestyle. However, Ryuko starts to feel lonely as Mako becomes more serious about her presidential duties and the other family members indulge in their wealth. Just as Ryuko decides to resign from the Fight Club, Satsuki gives Mako a Two-Star Goku Uniform, telling her to defeat Ryuko if she wants to keep her life of luxury. Ryuko takes the brunt of Mako`s attacks, which leads to Mako eventually realizing the error of her ways, disbanding the Fight Club and returning to her life in the slums. Meanwhile, Satsuki reveals that by using Ryuko to purge the weaker clubs, she will restructure the student council by holding a snap election.</summary>

<summary>After learning of his connection with Tsumugu, Ryuko tries to press Aikuro for more information, but does not get much outside of his organization`s name, Nudist Beach. Meanwhile, another of the Elite Four, Uzu Sanageyama, gets permission from Satsuki to fight against Ryuko himself. The next day, Uzu challenges Ryuko, facing against her in his Three-Star Goku Uniform, Blade Regalia. He has the advantage due to his fast eyesight reading all of Ryuko`s moves, but Ryuko overcomes this by using a part of her uniform to block Uzu`s vision, allowing her to defeat him and destroy his uniform. Refusing to give up, Uzu undergoes a drastic operation to sew his eyes shut, and challenges Ryuko again, this time using his other senses to predict her moves and completely overwhelm her. However, before Uzu can deliver the final blow, his Goku Uniform overheats due to him being more powerful than it can handle, giving Ryuko the opportunity to escape.</summary>

<summary>Houka Inumuta uses his Three-Star Goku Uniform, Probe Regalia, to analyze Ryuko`s fighting abilities and to anticipate her movements. When Ryuko counteracts this by fighting haphazardly, Houka resorts to cloaking himself and fighting her while invisible. Ryuko counters again by expanding and draping Senketsu`s eye across the battle arena, leaving him unable to evade, and then swatting the entire platform. Unwilling to lose the data he has gathered on Senketsu, Houka forfeits the match before Ryuko can destroy his uniform. Nonon Jakuzure is next; she activates her Three-Star Goku Uniform, Symphony Regalia, which initially is an array of speakers that attacks with sound, but later transforms into a hovering airship. She attempts to eliminate Ryuko by destroying the battle arena, but Ryuko activates a new aerial form, Senketsu Shippu, to remain in the match. Troubled by how quickly Senketsu has been evolving, Aikuro contacts Tsumugu, who makes his way to Honnouji Academy.</summary>

<summary>As Ryuko awaits the time for her battle against Ira, Aikuro asks her to drop out of the match, warning that she is not ready to face the Elite Four, to which she naturally declines. The battle soon begins, with Ira activating his Shackle Regalia, attacking himself in order to provide the power needed to transform into Scourge Regalia. Ryuko finds that the Shackle Regalia also serves as an armor protecting its Life Fibers, and is unable to damage the Shackle Regalia without powering up the Scourge Regalia form. Undeterred, Ryuko keeps on attacking, forcing Ira to bring out Scourge Regalia`s full power, attempting to forcefully mold Ryuko into a model student. However, Senketsu sets a plan into motion by pulling Ryuko out of her synchronized mode, allowing her to use Senketsu`s fangs to break into Ira`s uniform and destroy it from the inside using a new form, Senketsu Senjin, winning the match.</summary>

<summary>As Ryuko furiously attacks her, Nui recalls how she killed Isshin with the Rending Scissors he himself created and stole one of its blades, having her left eye slashed in the process. The boiling blood of Ryuko`s rage has an adverse effect on Senketsu, causing him to go berserk and consume her, resulting in a monstrous form. Mako and her family head towards the scene in order to save Ryuko from dying of blood loss, while Tsumugu tries to draw Nui away to give Aikuro the opportunity to use the adhesive bullet on Ryuko. Satsuki dons her Kamui in order to stop Ryuko, but it is Mako who manages to slap Ryuko to her senses and return her to her normal self, saving her life. Angered by Nui`s interference, Satsuki bans her from the school grounds. A few days later, as Ryuko recovers from her battle, Satsuki reveals that she was the one who ordered Nui to steal the sword scissors from Isshin, before announcing that Ryuko`s battles with the Elite Four have helped her perfect the Goku Uniforms so that they can take over every school that opposes them.</summary>

However, Nonon puts on an encore performance unleashing her uniform`s second form, Da Capo, using its music to disrupt Ryuko`s communication with Senketsu. Ryuko counters this by manipulating Nonon`s sound waves to match her own, before sending it back against Nonon and defeating her. Meanwhile, Tsumugu delivers a peculiar bullet to Aikuro, who is prepared to use it on Ryuko should the need arise. Just as Ryuko and Uzu are about to begin their match, a mysterious girl appears between them who Satsuki recognizes as Nui Harime, Grand Couturier of the Revocs Corporation owned by her mother, Ragyo Kiryuin. Nui instantly pulls apart Uzu`s uniform by breaking its Banshi, the Life Fiber that gives it its form. Receiving permission to fight Ryuko from a disconcerted Satsuki, Nui pulls out a purple scissor blade and tells Ryuko she was the one who killed Isshin, sending Ryuko into a fury.</summary>

Ryuko soon arrives on the scene to face against Satsuki, soon supported by the arrival of Aikuro, Tsumugu, and the Nudist Beach organization.

<summary>Shortly after the battle against Ragyo, a graduation ceremony is held at Honnouji, which is due to be dissolved. The ceremony is interrupted by duplicates of Satsuki and the Elite Four wearing Junketsu and Goku Uniforms. As Ryuko and the real Elite Four fight the doppelgangers, the real Satsuki and Mako are held captive by the true culprit, Rei, who attempts to exact revenge on Satsuki for her treachery. Rei attempts to take control of a giant mech formed from Honnouji itself, but Mako manages to briefly override it, encouraging Ryuko and the Elite Four to defeat the clones. Ryuko is knocked down a pit by Rei, but she hears Senketsu`s voice and receives the Scissor Blades, managing to transmogrify them into an even larger blade and finally destroy the mech, while Satsuki convinces Rei to surrender peacefully. Afterwards, everyone bids their farewells to Honnouji as it sinks to the bottom of the sea along with the Scissor Blades, while Ryuko takes comfort knowing that Senketsu is always with her.</summary>

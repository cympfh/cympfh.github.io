<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="357099">Quite decent animation and soundtracks, but apart from that this anime doesn`t have much to offer. The show is filled with unnecessarily ecchi scenes, obnoxious characters with little but no back story and an overuse of extreme slapstick jokes.
Don`t watch unless you`re a diehard fan of slapstick humor and ecchi.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="539481">A little bit ecchi in the start.funny sometimes.
Watch this because you like chaotic plots and like to be surprised.
Yet i found it a bit unfinished towards the end</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="332605">All around polished (style, animation, voices, music and story). THE wtf anime. The weird thing is, it eventually makes sense (like the third time).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="321954">great anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="141619">crazy anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="250088">I watched this anime 2 times, 1st time I had no freaking idea whats going, but still it was funny and good.
2nd time, I watched while I was high... I totally understood the anime and found it hilarious.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="522915">my favorite anime :P</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="500081">Definitely worth watching. At first it might seem "lolrandumb" style humor, and many will dismiss it as just that, but by the end of it, you see there`s a lot more going on just behind that veil, and the story it tells is a compelling and beautiful tale about love, betrayal, growing up, and overcoming life`s hardships one day at a time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="239305">you want something out of the box ?
need more weird, crazy, wtf moments ?
watch FLCL</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="385263">Great animation, great caracters. My current number 1.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="199844">*First, check to see if we share similar anime tastes.* I really got into this anime and even bought the OST. A great anime addition for any otaku starter kit.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="428629">a roller coaster. one of those anime that copied by many. but flcl specially this old version still rocks... artwork with no means and non stop creativity i love this..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="209807">Great example of how good anime can be, especially these days it`s a rare gem that people have to see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="374287">Good animation, really fitting soundtrack - and certain events were exceptional. Kept me hooked up constantly.
I`ve watched quite a lot of "similar" stuff, and FLCL was way better than most.

A very good show indeed. Despite being short.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="547633">One of my absolute all time favorites.
Random, Hilarious, and wow, the Music (complete soundtrack done by The Pillows).  This is really just a complete package.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="67070">Great ! Humor and tragedy, strangeness and parody, astonishment and perplexity, rock and roll ! What a feast !!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="420280">Wow!.....
This one will blow your mind,.. frequently.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="257822">Watched third time. Weird, unique Gainax mindf*ck, imho must see, also great soundtrack (the pillows).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="80160">You can`t consider yourself an anime fan without seeing this. The animation is incredible, the storyline bizarre, and the soundtrack is top notch. The shortness of this series allows you to watch it many times without it ever getting old. Don`t make this the first anime you ever watch though.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="355984">Gets better every time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="237158">Very FAST, very FUNNY, very FUNKY.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="478867">A surrealistic and metaphorical twist on a classic coming of age story. Animation sequences are top notch and you won`t know what hit you when you`ve seen it.</recommendation>

<name>energetic</name>
<description>An energetic character, often also called a genki character, shows great, often excessive levels of activity or vitality, and seems to always be doing everything extra fast. Genki characters are often slightly, or sometimes very, eccentric, and are filled with confidence and determination, regardless of whether they are competent or not; in fact, they often have little to no actual competence at whatever they generally do. Although genki characters are usually played exclusively for comedy effect, sometimes they may slow down for a serious or introspective moment. The most common genki character archetype is the genki schoolgirl, who will often be late to school and run with a toast in her mouth.</description>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>delinquent</name>
<description>Delinquents - Every school has them, but not all anime with school setting make delinquents a central topic. There are several versions of these delinquents, though some are grounded on a misunderstanding:
* The student with a really bad image and attitude, based on his real criminal actions outside of the school and is even feared by teachers.
* The primitive "class bully" that pushes around ("clobbers") his classmates for no apparent reason, possibly extorting lunch money.
* The student with an sinister complexion or "evil eye", but is actually a "good" student (unfoundedly feared character).
* The rebellious student, who does not care for studying, but is otherwise docile. Called a "delinquent" as a joke.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.
If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>absurdist humour</name>
<description>Surreal humour, also known as absurdist humour, is a form of humour predicated on deliberate violations of causal reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations, and expressions of nonsense.
The humour arises from a subversion of audience`s expectations, so that amusement is founded on unpredictability, separate from a logical analysis of the situation. Its appeal stems from the fact that the situation described is exceedingly ridiculous or unlikely.
On an analytical level, all jokes contain a certain amount of incongruity, but while regular jokes carry an incongruity that the audience accepts as compatible with expectations, absurd jokes are characterized by a disproportionate amount of it, with the punch line delivering a situation incompatible with the world as we know it and failing to resolve the matter in the audience`s eyes.

<name>medium awareness</name>
<description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example, they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen, inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and outside it, to the audience.</description>

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

<name>Haruhara Haruko</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Haruko Haruhara is an energetic, spontaneous hotpink-haired girl from outer-space, and investigator for the Galactic Space Patrol Brotherhood/Stellar Fraternity. Mamimi observes that she looks at least twenty years old, though she claims to be 19. But it is impossible to know, especially since Haruko is not even human. She wears a bright red coat, black pants, white boots, and lemon chiffon colored scarf. She rides a sunglow Piaggio Vespa SS 180 (becoming known as The Wasp Woman, a pun on the word Vespa, which means wasp) and wields a navy blue, left-handed Rickenbacker bass guitar model 4001 (similar to the 4001S used by Paul McCartney, whom she mentions in episode five, but hers has a lefty neck with a righty body). It can be used as an axe-like melee weapon, shoot bullets, act as a rocket launcher, and is used several times to open N.O. channels. She also seems to use it to fly. She leaves it for a more powerful, double-necked guitar/bass (a fusion of Naota`s Gibson Flying V and Atomsk`s 1961 Gibson EB-0 that Naota creates while harnessing Atomsk`s power) when she departs from Earth in episode six.
She becomes the Nandaba household`s maid and plays on a rival team of the Mabase Martians, seemingly for extra money, but in fact to knock a satellite out of Earth`s orbit with the baseballs she hits. She has also apparently had past relations with Amarao, most likely similar to her relationship with Naota. This mysterious character is the catalyst for FLCL`s entire plot. She is called Haruha Raharu by Amarao; this may be another alias however. In episode 2 she claims to be a first class space patrol officer, in which she looks like an alien space angel.
Haruko has connections to the Nandaba family cat, Miu Miu. The cat serves as a "walkie talkie" to her superiors. The cat does not speak (besides its "meows" and grunts) but it is obvious that Haruko is getting some kind of reply, as her conversations with Miu Miu indicate.
At the end of the manga adaptation, a character identical to Haruko appears from Naota`s forehead. She claims to be "Haruha Raharu`s superior [...] Superior Raharu" and that Haruko is on the run from the Galaxy Space Police Brotherhood. It is made obvious that it is Haruko pretending to be someone else after she kisses Naota.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Commander Amarao works for the department of Interstellar Immigration, a men in black like agency. This agency, among other things, acts as a middle man for negotiations between the government and Medical Mechanica. Amarao has fake eyebrows made of nori which he believes serve the dual purpose of protecting him from N.O. and making him look macho. Amarao seems to have had a past relationship with Haruko similar to Naota`s. There are some traces of him feeling jealous that Haruko has chosen Naota over him.
He first appears in the fourth episode of the series, giving viewers the impression that he is virtually an omniscient character, giving background information as well as making fairly accurate predictions. However, subsequent events would show him as extremely weak and very limited in foresight, though he seems to grasp what is happening better than almost all the other characters.
He has a love for sickeningly sweet candy and drinks (which he claims will help people`s heads back to normal), and hates spicy, sour, and pulpy foods — much like Naota. His vehicle of choice is a Fuji Rabbit, a motor scooter which was initially produced in 1946 six months prior to the initial production of the Vespa. Given that throughout the series Amarao is constantly trying to impress Haruko, who rides a Vespa, one could conclude his ownership of a scooter is a further manifestation of his attempts to impress her — or at the very least a signal to the level at which Haruko influenced him in his youth.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Atomsk, also known as the "Pirate King" (海賊王 Kaizoku-Ou), is an enigmatic character, apparently the most powerful "space pirate" in the galaxy. His N.O. is great enough to steal entire solar systems. His physical appearance is that of a bird-like creature resembling a phoenix. He has a nose ring identical to the metal Ring on Haruko`s bracelet, which allows her to detect Atomsk`s presence or the activation of N.O. in general. The director`s commentary explains that this is a remnant from the original story, in which Haruko was a space officer and Atomsk was her prisoner with whom she fell in love. They scrapped the idea but kept the bracelet, and a few discreet references to Haruko`s past.
Amarao portrays him inaccurately, imagining Atomsk`s appearance as a humanoid male figure with fiery red hair when he describes him to Naota. In an interview, the director clarifies that Atomsk`s true form is indeed that of the bird, and Amarao`s mental image was of a man because he believed that Atomsk and Haruko were lovers, which was later exposed to be false; Amarao looks very surprised when he sees Atomsk`s true form. It is the desire to obtain him and gain his power for herself that drives Haruko to constantly follow Atomsk, regardless of the damage she causes along the way. Atomsk`s bass guitar is a 1961 Gibson EB-0.
Although Atomsk manifest himself physically only at the end, he takes active part in the plot, mainly by controlling Canti. In some way he is a symbol of an absolute masculinity in the series.</description>

<name>Nandaba Naota</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Naota Nandaba is the main character. His name is derived from the Japanese word for "honesty". Unbeknownst to him, he has the "right kind of head" to be used as an N.O. channel.
Naota is obsessed with appearing mature and attempts to act nonchalant. Naota idolizes his older brother Tasuku, carrying around Tasuku`s baseball bat, and even hanging out with Tasuku`s old girlfriend Mamimi. In Naota`s mind, Tasuku is the epitome of what it means to be an adult, that`s why he looks up to him (In fact, the name is a wordplay on "Tasukete!" - "help!" in Japanese), as opposed to the other adults in his life (e.g. his father, his grandfather, and his teacher) who he perceives as being immature.
While at the beginning of the series Naota appears to be bothered by Haruko`s presence, over the course of the series he realizes his own feelings and admits that he loves her, along with embracing her with a kiss, in the final episode. His bass is the Rickenbacker 4001 which was Haruko`s, but she leaves it behind when she takes the new combination of his Gibson Flying V and Atomsk`s Gibson EB-0.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Eri Ninamori is Naota`s classmate. In the series, she is referred to as `Ninamori,` her last name. She is the daughter of the mayor of Mabase and is class president.
She projects a proper, even slightly stuck-up personality, and conceals personal information to an almost obsessive degree; she does not even let her classmates know that she needs corrective lenses, instead wearing contacts while at school. Even with her class president status, however, Eri isn`t above breaking the rules to get what she wants. She rigs the voting during the casting for the school play in order to get the lead role and have Naota cast opposite her, which (along with letting him see her wearing glasses) hints at her crush on Naota. Other hints are her expressed dislike of Mamimi and Haruko and a final scene with Naota by a vending machine that mirrors Mamimi and Naota`s early-series interactions. Ninamori is highly intelligent, if a little jaded. Much like Naota, Ninamori attempts to act mature, and although her parents` problems trouble her deeply, she refuses to admit it until near the end of the series.
Ninamori has N.O. powers as well, though they only manifest once when Naota hit his head on hers. In this instance, Naota`s third robot, which appears at first as "cat ears", transfers to her instantly when the Medical Factory`s siren blows. In the manga, an octopus-like robot comes forth, before running away with Naota and appears very little after that until it helps her save Naota from an angered Haruko.</description>

<description>Samejima Mamimi believed herself as Tasuku`s (Naota`s older brother) girlfriend, though she is in some sort of relationship with Naota since his brother left Japan. She is a truant high school student with pyromaniacal tendencies; she also smokes a lot and spends most of her time under a bridge. She is often seen with a camera, and always smokes a worn cigarette with "Never Knows Best" written onto the paper. It is implied that she is often bullied at school, causing her to often ditch.
In episode three, "Marquis de Carabas," it is hinted that her parents are separated or gone, suggesting that she is homeless or leaves her home to get away from something.
She has the peculiar tendency to name people and things "Ta-kun" (sometimes spelled "Takkun"), after her personal nickname for Naota`s brother (and Naota himself). Mamimi is likely using Naota as a substitute for Tasuku and therefore refers to him as "Ta-kun" which can be short for both Naota and Tasuku. Mamimi also calls Tasuku "Tasuku-senpai" since he is an older classmate.
The story originally sets forth that her fascination with fire stems from Tasuku having rescued her from the elementary school fire, although it is later hinted that she was the one who started that fire, given that she expresses her hate of her old elementary school, and her disappointment that the ashes still remain. Mamimi holds an almost quixotically weak grip on the difference between fantasy and reality; for example, she believes Canti to be the manifestation of Cantido, the video game god to whom she burns things as sacrifices. She also emanates an aura of benign vapidness that causes much of the cast (Naota`s classmates especially) to look upon her with disdain.
At the end of the series, she leaves Mabase to become a professional photographer. Her last words with Naota are at the end of Brittle Bullet when Naota makes the ultimate independent act of rejecting her affection outright and refusing to be called Ta-kun ever again. In Naota`s monolouge at the end of FLCLimax, he says the last words she said to him before leaving to be a photographer were "So long, Naota".</description>

<name>Canti</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Canti is a robot with what looks like a television set for a head. After having his head broken by Haruko, he is recruited by her as an assistant; however, he proves to be no good for much other than washing dishes and fetching drinks for the family.
He was manufactured by Medical Mechanica, but taken over by Atomsk as a way to escape them. Atomsk can manifest through Canti, with Naota being the catalyst. Atomsk`s symbol appears on Canti`s screen when he absorbs Naota; the symbol is a corruption of the kanji characters for "adult" (大人). This symbol also appears on him when Naota "swings the bat" in Full Swing. The symbol that appears when Canti is absorbed by the terminal core in FLCLimax is similar, but he uses the characters for "child" (小人) instead. When Naota is absorbed, Canti`s physical strength is increased and he gains the ability to transform into a canon, that utilizes pilot as a munition.
The emotions of Canti are very human-like, despite his looks. He is embarrassed about his broken head (where Haruko hit him) and is looking for the pieces to glue back together in episode two. He wears the box on the back of his head for the same reason. Canti seems to like porn, as he was reading it in the 7-11. It is also stated in the novel, that Canti spends 3 hours at a time looking through `perverted magazines.` He is also extremely polite, extending a helping hand to Lieutenant Kitsurubami even after she attempted to destroy him.
Canti also dons a halo and fake wings which Haruko puts on him earlier in the episode. Mamimi is convinced that Canti is an angel. She calls him "Canti-sama" after "The Lord of Black Flames" in a video game she plays. The rest of the cast call him by this title throughout the rest of the series.</description>

<name>Nandaba Kamon</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kamon Nandaba is Naota`s father, a former pop culture journalist working as a freelance writer, with his own trashy tabloid: "Kamon-Mabase" (the title is a pun of "come-on mabase"). He makes the most references to pop culture: EVA, "Monkey-sensei" (referring to the creator of the series Lupin III), Hamtaro, Mobile Suit Gundam, and MTV to name a few.
Kamon has taken a liking to Haruko, but she only wants to use him as an N.O. portal. In the fourth episode, Naota discovers that Haruko tried to use him but "his head didn`t work" and that she had left a robot replacement to putter around the house. The real Kamon is found conservated (dehydrated) in a cabinet but is brought back to life by being contacted with water in a small bathtub. Haruko`s true intentions of coming to Mabase are revealed through her interactions with Kamon. After realizing that his head didn`t open the N.O. portal, she discards him and returns to using Naota, saying "you`re the only one who works." Like the other adults in FLCL, Kamon is extremely immature, normally more so than the other adults. However, he shows a surprising amount of seriousness and thoughtfulness at some points in the anime.</description>

<description>Shigekuni Nandaba is Naota`s grandfather. He owns the family bakery and coaches the local baseball team, the Mabase Martians. He despises Mamimi for unspecified reasons, but it is suggested that he didn`t approve of Tasuku dating her. Shigekuni values baseball more than anything in the world — he is disappointed in his own son and younger grandson because they are lousy baseball players. He does not defend Naota as the other players mock him, because he holds too much pride for Tasuku. He enjoys taking advantage of Canti as much as Kamon does. He has an affinity for pornography. In the first episode, he mistakes "furi kuri" with "kuri kuri," a sound effect often used in hentai during any twisting motion, often breasts or nipples, although the same onomatopoeia stands for kneading dough.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Lieutenant Kitsurubami is an attractive young woman and second in command on Amarao`s staff in the Interstellar Immigration Bureau. She is often seen either giving out vital mission data, or on the field in investigations with Amarao. Amarao hits on her in the final episode, but she resists him. In fact, Kitsurubami seems to be generally disgusted by the idea of romantic involvement (and likely any form of physical contact) with Amarao though she looks up to him as a superior and follows his orders loyally. She also seems to become smitten with Canti, despite her initial efforts to attack him with a large caliber sniper rifle.
Kitsurubami is named after a light brown traditional Japanese color, which happens to be the color of her skin. Thus, her name could be interpreted as "Lieutenant Brown", although the color Kitsurubami is not the common "brown." She appears to be the only "normal" (or mature) adult in FLCL.</description>

<description>Gaku is one of Naota`s classmates and close friends and is obsessed with kissing and other things of sexual behaviour. In episode three, "Marquis de Carabas," he plays the part of a mouse in the school play. Gaku also uses the word "chu" constantly, especially when referring to Haruko. This is a pun in Japanese, because "chu" is the Japanese onomatopoeia for both kissing and the sound a mouse makes. He`s somewhat hyper and is usually seen with Masashi. He is an encyclopedia of bizarre rumors and legends, many of which are sexual in nature. He consistently refers to Mamimi as Naota`s "wife".</description>

<description>Miyu-Miyu is simply a Nandaba famaly`s old fat cat. He is short and ill tempered. He may seem friendly, but if he wants to, he can hurt you. Also, he`s not neutered and has a crippled tail.
His name is a pun on Evangelion`s comic relief animal character Pen Pen and he is also voiced by Evangelion`s director Hideaki Anno.
Apperantly Miyu-Miyu can open N.O. channel wide enough to transfer information. Unlike human channel like Naota, a cat can`t understand the information being transfered through it so Haruko uses him as an interstellar communication device. The link seems to be interactive, because her superior is able to punish Haruko physically by controlling Miyu-Miyu.</description>

<name>Red Canti</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>http://anidb.net/ch10207 [Canti], when an enemy is sited, loses control of himself and turns red. In this mode he is the opposite of his normal shy and obedient self - a true fighter. In addition, though he can fight on his own, he needs a "pilot", that must literally be eaten to assume his position in the "cockpit".
Only in this form he can transform in a cannon.
There are some strong hints in the plot, that Canti is being controlled by http://anidb.net/ch10127 [Atomsk]. Actually, this state is his original, that was "cut off" by http://anidb.net/ch5487 [Haruko] when hit on the head.
Later on revealed that Cannon-form uses the pilot as the ammunition for shooting. This is a joke-reply by GAINAX to the Xenogears game by Square, which was heavily influenced by http://anidb.net/a22 [NGE] and where one of the strongest attacks was shooting the pilot as a bullet from the transformed mecha.
Possibly, only with N.O.-capable pilot Canti gains the ability to open N.O. channel to transport matter (Atomsk`s guitar and later himself).</description>

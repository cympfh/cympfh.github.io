<p>The BNUUY Burrows are not a nice place‚ would have been voted the worst place to be‚ but that is democracy‚ and that was couped away․ Cardboard boxes as tables‚ trash every where․ Empty bottles‚ glass shards and broken vending machines‚ loud music blaring and neon colours of the future․ Probably the worst place to play Mahjong‚ but sometimes you don't care․ And there is even graffitti cans to make the trash filled alley even worse with your own creations․ Warning for blinking lights and loud musicǃ</p>

<description>In 22XX, with a sudden decrease in the human population, various allied species coming from other planets are invited to populate the Earth. As a result, new mixed races with special abilities began to be born, causing ecosystems to be machined at an accelerating rate where the plants and animals are being excluded.
Among them, a special tribe who can manipulates plants has been exterminated, but only one of them survives and try to accomplish the mission to cover the earth with forests. The protagonist named Yuki, born from his father, member of the Hero tribe, and his mother with the ability to manipulate plants, gains the skills of both tribes, and he asks himself who should he help and who should he fight.

<description>The Young Animator Training Project is an annual project launched in 2010 and funded by the Japanese government`s Agency for Cultural Affairs. The project, which culminates in a series of shorts produced by various animation studios each year, means to address the concern that more of the Japanese animation process is being outsourced overseas, thus leading to a decline in opportunities to teach animation techniques within Japan. As such, the animation production for each short is required to be based in Japan, and professionals must impart their know-how to the young animators through on-the-job training.

<description>Many anime are created as part of larger projects encompassing many shows without direct relation to one another. Normally, there is a specific idea in mind: for example, the http://anidb.net/t4859 [Young Animator Training Project] aims to stimulate the on-the-job training of next-generation professionals of the anime industry, whereas the http://anidb.net/t3763 [World Masterpiece Theatre] aims to animate classical stories from all over the world.</description>

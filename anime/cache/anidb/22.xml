<recommendation type="Must See" uid="257822">Well known classic, yet so stunning. Epic plot, totally must see for anyone who wanna go into anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="346737">Really irritating that this anime is not rated higher... this is definitely one of those "if you watch anime and you haven`t watched this you fail" situations =P</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="546498">Definitely a classic. Interesting on many levels and rather dark at times. While it is indeed a must see it also has the dubious distinction of having the worst ending of any anime series I have seen. You really must see and decide for yourself but totally worth watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="446193">Psychological, controversial, twisting, and terrifying; Evangelion as a whole is a precedent in the [Mecha] genre, and even the industry.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="537611">A very deep and psychological series. Its characters set the standard for new anime shows today. One of my personal favorites</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="57320">Most epic anime I`ve ever seen. And my favorite picture.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="241883">It`s recommended full-heartly, but don`t let it`s hype create larger expectations!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="469237">Definitely a psycho-killer. I loved the whole psychology part of the series, especially on its second part. Good robo-action series, until it reaches its pinnacle, the last 7-8 episodes. From then on, my opinion is that you need a lot of patience to watch it, but I recommend you do it, it`s totally worth it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="385974">No body should miss this anime. It is so famous to the point that you`d think that it is one of those overrated anime but it`s not and don`t be discouraged because it is very old It`s still one of the best anime  even the animation is great.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="573230">A must see masterpiece, this is no ordinary mecha show, all the environment is great and the characters are lovable, the way this show made me feel was just too good to describe, it drives you insane, the ending makes you feel kinda WTF and is that WTFness that makes you feel so great watching it and never bored.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="150612">Dark, morbid, beautiful. Evangelion is one of few series that embeds itself into your mind many years after you first see it. Though the pacing can seem slow at times, it builds momentum perfectly as it comes to its rather bizarre conclusion. The show marks the birth of many of anime`s best characters and character archetypes - both hated and loved. Regardless of individual opinions, every character here has an astonishing depth to them. You`ll find nothing short of masterful work here.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="324043">interesting story, little annoying characters and ecchi.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="686104">It`s most epic, most mind fucking most horrific beautiful anime you will ever regret 
loving. 
Prepare your mind to be raped long dick style by unimaginable feels. This is the best thing I`ve ever seen.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="243684">One of the main pillars of anime as a genre and one of the few animes, that make you think and not just consume.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="361412">Probably the most influential and memorable anime ever. Don`t be bother by the fact that it`s pretty bad both at storytelling and sometimes execution</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="396578">Fantastic.....ITALIANO: assolutamente da vedere, non può mancare nella vostra collezione....</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="237158">What to say ... ANIME ELABORATE on EVERYTHING. With main focus on human psychology and coming of age, using religion to power-up physics, excluding religion to find God. This anime is simply exquisite. Be sure to check HD remakes.</recommendation>

<description>In the year 2015, the Angels, huge, tremendously powerful, alien war machines, appear in Tokyo for the second time. The only hope for mankind`s survival lies in the Evangelion, a humanoid fighting machine developed by http://anidb.net/ch5009 [NERV], a special United Nations agency. Capable of withstanding anything the Angels can dish out, the Evangelions` one drawback lies in the limited number of people able to pilot them. Only a handful of teenagers, all born fourteen years ago, nine months after the Angels first appeared, are able to interface with an Evangelion.
One such teenager is http://anidb.net/ch309 [Ikari Shinji], whose father heads the NERV team that developed and maintains the Evangelions. Thrust into a maelstrom of battles and events that he does not understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the depths of his own inner resources for the courage and strength to not only fight, but to survive, or risk losing everything.
Note: The 2003 Renewal of Evangelion is the final remastered version. It includes:

* http://anidb.net/a22 [The original TV series], episodes 1-20
* The Director`s Cut of episodes 21-24 of the original TV series
* http://anidb.net/a326 [Death(True)^2], released on the ninth disc with the label of Revival of Evangelion
* http://anidb.net/a202 [The End of Evangelion], released on the tenth disc, with the label Evangelion – The Feature Film

<name>moe</name>
<description>Moe is a Japanese slang loanword that refers to feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, and video games. Moe, however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. Moe can be related to lust; however, pure lust without other feelings is considered outside its scope. The word Moe originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use.
At the anime level, the http://anidb.net/t7146 [cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT)] tag may also apply.

<name>air force</name>
<description>An air force, also known in some countries as an air army or air corps, is in the broadest sense, the national military organization that primarily conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of a nation`s armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from an army, navy or other branch. Typically, air forces are responsible for gaining control of the air, carrying out strategic-bombing missions and providing support to surface forces.
The term "air force" may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air force, which is an operational formation within a national air force. Air forces typically consist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters, transport planes and other aircraft.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<tag id="2607" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2009-04-29">
<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<tag id="2608" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2012-12-04">
<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Human enhancement can take various forms: It can be something comparatively non-intrusive as a power-up drug, a form of machine implantation or cyberization (http://anidb.net/a4414 [SAC Solid State Society]), or outright - possibly atrocious - genetic manipulation (http://anidb.net/a361 [Ao no 6 Gou]). Plot-wise enhanced protagonists in anime usually have to pay a price for their enhancements, be it physical or mental.</description>

<name>nudity</name>
<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.
Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page] for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.
Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

<name>ecchi</name>
<description>Fan service is found in many anime, in many forms. When the service has a distinctly sexual slant to it, and it appears to be a major focus of the show, then it`s safe to assume you`re watching ecchi.
The word "ecchi" is used by English-speaking anime fans to refer to refer to soft-core pornographic or sexually suggestive anime and manga. This is a western invention; in Japanese, it is a catch-all term for all things anyhow sexual in nature, not being limited to porn, but also not really considered a "milder" term, as it may also refer to sexual intercourse itself. The term "ecchi" in Japanese comes from the pronunciation of the letter "H" in English, which is rendered into Japanese syllabary as エッチ, which in turn is transliterated in the English alphabet as "ecchi" or "etchi". It is not, as many believe, short for "hentai" -- that, too, seems to be a western invention. It is, however, nearly as misunderstood and misapplied a term as "hentai".
The line between ecchi and hentai, from the western perspective over these terms, can be hard to draw at times; one good rule of thumb is: if it was aired on Japanese public TV at all, it probably wasn`t hentai. Ecchi usually features all the specifics to human anatomy that can only be found in anime, and generally avoids full nudity, instead abusing of panty shots. Hentai, on the other hand, will usually show full frontal nudity in some explicit form, including genitalia, and full, intimate sex scenes. At its mildest, ecchi is composed of double entendres, big misunderstandings, and sexual farce; at its most explicit, it is still in the realm of softcore pornography, with full breast shots, full back nudity and similar content, but no display of genitalia. Another good way to distinguish the two is looking for animated sex scenes; if one is found, you have generally left the genre entirely, though a few borderline exceptions apply here. For AniDB`s purposes, the distinction between explicit ecchi and actual hentai is simple: if it was sold with a 18+ restriction in its country of origin, it is hentai; if it was sold without it, it is ecchi.

The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>post-apocalyptic</name>
<description>An anime that takes place on future Earth (or it could be an alternative universe) after a major cataclysm has occurred. World War III, an alien invasion, plague, global warming or some other general disaster are common themes to build a post-apocalyptic world upon, where the effects were severe enough that mankind barely survived.
The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologised). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between post-apocalyptic fiction and that which deals with false utopias or dystopian societies.</description>

The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<description>A `mind fuck` is a slang term which describes a work that uses literary devices such as nonlinear storytelling and plot twists in order to present convoluted, yet not conflicting, themes.
A creation is usually considered a mind fuck when a casual observer is not able to discern the true meaning of a work without making a serious attempt to unravel the themes presented or when the plot is incredibly difficult to follow.
Special examples of mind fucks involve a single plot twist which completely changes the viewer`s understanding of the events in a film or novel as well as the ideas it presents.</description>

<description>In this anime, some characters "speak" foreign languages, successfully making the audience`s ears bleed. That is especially true if the viewer is a native speaker of or otherwise proficient in the languages in question.
The foreigners in the show do not seem to take much notice of the fact that their supposed native languages are being massacred. In fact, oftentimes they also actively participate in the butchering of said languages. That happens, of course, because they, too, are voiced by Japanese people without knowledge of the language they`re supposed to speak, or to pretend to speak at any rate.</description>

The main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; early English-language games only feature Banpresto`s original characters and mecha, and a flagship installment were to never be released until 2016, with the English release of Super Robot Wars V in Southeast Asian countries. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.

Asuka is a native of Germany, having been raised there, though her nationality is technically American. Asuka`s native language is German, and in both the series and the manga she tends to curse in German. She is a child prodigy and has earned a university degree in an unspecified field as a teenager; she also speaks fluent Japanese, but has trouble reading and writing kanji. She is characterized by her fiery red hair and equally fiery temper. Asuka is very proud of being an Eva pilot, and near-constantly wears her A10 nerve clips in her hair, because she wants everyone around her to know that she is a pilot.</description>

<description>The operations director at Nerv. Her duties at Nerv include acting as a field commander for the Eva pilots, issuing orders and relaying battle strategies as well as processing input from Akagi Ritsuko and the technicians monitoring the Evas. She also handles many bureaucratic aspects of Nerv`s operations.
At the beginning of the series, Misato first brings Shinji Ikari to Nerv and is able to convince him to pilot the Eva Unit 01. She then chooses to have Shinji move in with her rather than live alone, and later takes in Sohryu Asuka Langley. As the series progresses, through her former lover Kaji Ryouji she learns the truth behind the Human Instrumentality Project and the depths of deception that Nerv and Seele have gone to keep the Project secret, even from her.
While on the job, Misato is very professional and capable, in stark contrast to her life at home. Until Shinji`s arrival, her living space was a complete mess. She cannot cook for herself and relies solely on instant food (she is often considered gross by Shinji and Ritsuko for combining food like ramen and curry). She also drinks copious quantities of beer, and drinks one first thing in the morning to get her day started (later in the series she apparently switches to canned coffee as a supplement). She also smokes, though only occasionally and only during chaotic events.</description>

<description>Nerv`s head scientist and heavily involved in the repairs and maintenance of Tokyo-3`s defences against the Angels, particularly the Evas.
She is the daughter of Akagi Naoko, the developer of the MAGI supercomputer system which controls Nerv. In many ways, Ritsuko is living in the shadow of her mother, whom she both admires and despises. Naoko was the head scientist working on the Evangelion project before her death, and Ritsuko is continuing the work her mother began with the Evas, as well as continuing the development of the Magi supercomputer system. Flashbacks to a teenaged Ritsuko reveal that she is a natural brunette, just like her mother.
Ritsuko is extremely intelligent, with a strong dedication to her work and a stoic, detached attitude which is frequently contrasted against Katsuragi Misato`s hot-headness, especially during Eva combat. Her occasional jibes at Misato are a source of comic relief in the series. She has a great affinity for cats, and Misato chides her at one point for substituting her cats for human affection. She also is a heavy smoker, as evidenced by an ashtray on her desk filled with cigarette butts stained by her lipstick.</description>

<description>An organisation led by Ikari Gendou and tasked with defending Earth against the Angels through use of the Evangelion units. It was formerly known as Gehirn, a UN Research Agency. It was reorganised into Nerv once Nerv HQ and Tokyo-3 became fully operational. There are several global branches of Nerv besides the main headquarters under Tokyo-3 itself.
The Nerv Logo is half a fig leaf covering its name, with the motto "God`s In His Heaven... All`s Right With The World" forming the quarter circle on the bottom. The motto comes from Robert Browning`s poem "Pippa Passes."
In Genesis 3:7, Adam and Eve cover their "nakedness" with fig leaves. The fig leaf has covered nakedness in art and sculpture for hundreds of years, symbolically representing the guilt of original sin.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The third Angel, Sachiel, is the first Angel to attack Tokyo-3. It is a massive, vaguely humanoid creature with large bony structures on its shoulders and torso, gill-like structures on its legs, tridactyl hands, and a distinctive beaked face (a second face, behind and slightly to the side of the first one, is generated after an N² bomb is dropped on the Angel). It has a powerful long-range energy blast, which distinctly forms a Christian cross on detonation, and two sharp spikes which slide through its arms and extend through holes in its palms as striking weapons (when retracted, the spikes extend from the Angel`s elbows) Its core is located prominently on its chest.
After easily defeating the UN military forces sent to attack it, Sachiel was briefly stopped by an N² bomb, from which it quickly recovered. It then fought Unit 01, in Ikari Shinji`s first battle against an Angel. Initially, Sachiel defeated Unit 01, driving a spike through the Eva`s head. However, the Eva went "berserk", re-engaged Sachiel, and inflicted massive damage to the Angel`s core with a broken piece of one of Sachiel`s ribs. The Angel then attached itself to Unit 01 and self-destructed, but failed to destroy Unit 01.
Sachiel demonstrates impressive regenerative abilities, recovering from an N² bomb in a matter of hours. The Angel also seems to have a limited ability to alter its own body structure, as demonstrated when it bulges its arm muscles to stop a missile, when it snaps Unit 01`s arm, and when it partly envelops Unit 01 and self-destructs.</description>

<description>The fourth Angel, Shamshel, is a massive, vaguely arthropod-like creature, with a long cylindrical body, a roughly shovel-shaped head with two eyespot-like markings, and eight retractable segmented limbs. It also has two short "arms" that project energy whips, which can easily slice through objects and may also be used to manipulate objects. Shamshel remains horizontal during flight; during combat it raises itself upright by 90 degrees, with the "head" remaining parallel to the ground. Its core is located under its "throat".
Shamshel was engaged by Shinji in Unit 01. During the battle, Unit 01`s umbilical cable was severed by Shamshel`s energy whips, and Shinji had to fight the Angel on battery power. Ignoring orders to retreat, Shinji inflicted a fatal wound to the Angel`s core using Unit 01`s progressive knife, killing it seconds before Unit 01`s batteries expired. The minimal damage to Shamshel allowed Nerv to obtain a near-complete Angel specimen, although no report was ever submitted or published. Nerv was able to recover the Angel`s S² engine, which the Third Branch would later attempt to install in Unit 04.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The fifth Angel, Ramiel, is a translucent and hollow octahedron. Ramiel defends itself with a proton particle beam that automatically targets any hostile object within a certain radius or any direct threat outside of it. It also bears an AT field so powerful that it visibly warps light passing through it. It extends a drill bit from its bottom apex and attempts to bore through the armour above the GeoFront, in the first credible attempt to reach Terminal Dogma. Despite being one of the most powerful and formidable Angels, Ramiel is very passive in nature, using a slowly moving drill to bore into the GeoFront while using its deadly energy attacks only for defensive purposes. Ramiel`s core is not shown, but it is implied to be deep within the Angel`s body. Rebuild of Evangelion reveals Ramiel`s core at the centre of its body.
Ramiel was defeated by Rei and Shinji in a coordinated assault (the two pilots` first operation together). Shinji used a positron cannon appropriated from the JSSDF and powered with the entire Japanese power grid, and Rei protected Shinji using a special shield constructed from the heat shield of an SSTO spacecraft(in the anime series, the shield is said to come from the American Space Shuttle). The overall plan was named Yashima. Ramiel reacted and fired at the same time as Shinji. The two beams met each other, warping each other and causing both to miss. Ramiel fired a second shot before the positron cannon could fully recharge; Rei blocked the beam, first with the shield and then with Unit 00 itself after the shield was destroyed. This bought Shinji enough time to fire a second shot after the cannon recharged, which passed through Ramiel`s centre and killed it. Like Shamshel, Ramiel`s corpse remained intact and was shown over the next several episodes being gradually deconstructed.</description>

<description>The sixth Angel, Gaghiel, is an aquatic being with a massive body and long jaws filled with sharp teeth. It also has a small "face" similar to Sachiel`s on its forehead, and its core is located in its mouth. It is extremely strong, and can use parts of its body to easily slice up combat warships. Unlike the preceding Angels, it does not generate a visible AT field (though it does not appear to be damaged by any fire from the naval vessels around it).
Gaghiel attacked the UN Pacific fleet as it was delivering Unit 02 and (secretly) the preserved embryonic Adam to Nerv. Gaghiel was searching for the Adam embryo, but because the presence of the embryo was secret (apparently even from Seele), Nerv officially reported that Gaghiel was drawn by Unit 02. It managed to damage or destroy almost one third of the UN`s combined fleet.
Gaghiel fought with Unit 02, piloted jointly by Asuka Langley Souryu and Shinji Ikari in their first battle together. Asuka brashly challenges Gaghiel in Unit 02 wearing only B-type equipment (unsuited for marine combat). Gaghiel does not knock Unit 02 into the ocean. Instead, a miscalculation by Asuka makes Unit 02 step onto a flight deck elevator which collapses, throwing the Eva and the Angel into the water, where Asuka and Shinji find themselves immobilized. The Angel bites down on them, trapping them in its jaws. Misato hatches a plan, and Unit 02 forces the Angel`s mouth open (though only with Asuka and Shinji working and thinking in unison), allowing a pair of scuttled Iowa-class battleships (the Illinois and Kentucky) to lodge in its mouth (knocking out most of its teeth in the process) and fire (via remote control) at the Angel`s core, then self-destruct inside the Angel, killing it.</description>

<description>The seventh Angel, Israfel, has the appearance of a massive, vaguely humanoid creature, similar to Sachiel. Israfel has a face/mask, reminiscent of Sachiel`s, which resembles a yin-yang symbol. Israfel has a pair of razor sharp claws and a weak energy beam (compared to other Angels). Its AT field appears to be relatively weak. It has two cores located in its chest, matched on either side of its centre torso by four external bone-like rib structures.
Israfel`s most notable weapon is its ability to split itself into separate, twin Angels, referred to as "Alpha" and "Beta" in the English translation and "Kou" and "Otsu" in the original Japanese. The twin Angels are almost identical in appearance and properties to the original (except in colour scheme). Both have faces/masks with three eye holes and possess their own cores, though they lack the rib structures in their chest(s). They (apparently) use synchronized tactics to fight enemies. Both cores must be destroyed at the same time, or they will heal each other.
After emerging from the ocean, Israfel was engaged by Asuka and Shinji. Defying orders to attack in synch with Shinji, Asuka assaulted the Angel alone, cleaving it in two. Shocking everyone, Israfel split into its twins, and decisively defeated Asuka and Shinji. To Nerv`s embarrassment, the UN Secondary Command was allowed to take over the battle, and an N² bomb was dropped on the Angel, vaporising 28% of its mass. The Angel was incapacitated for roughly six days, during which time it recovered from its injuries.
Israfel was defeated through a synchronized attack by Shinji and Asuka, concerted via a musical score and with the memorization of numerous dance moves, first forcing the Angel to split into its twins, then back into its singular mode, this time with the two cores exposed which were destroyed simultaneously.</description>

<description>The eighth Angel, Sandalphon, is similar in form to the aquatic Cambrian predator Anomalocaris. It appears to have no abilities beyond its extraordinary resistance to heat and pressure, up to the point of being able to open its mouth in magma. Its own AT field was never strong enough to physically manifest. Its core was never depicted.
Sandalphon was discovered in an embryonic state deep inside the Mount Asama volcano. Nerv was determined to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to strike first against an Angel. Asuka, in Unit 02, was sent to capture the Angel using a special electromagnetic cage. The Eva`s normal B-type equipment was not designed for extreme environments, so Unit 02 was equipped with the D-type Equipment, specifically designed for extreme conditions like magma. During the operation the Angel awoke, rapidly developed into its adult form, and attacked Unit 02, damaging it, however Unit 02 could not take any countermeasure due to the fact that it had lost its progressive knife earlier from the pressure of the lava (It was sent over the depth limit of the D-type equipment). Sandalphon was defeated by Asuka using the D-type equipment`s coolant (inspired by an earlier conversation with Shinji regarding thermal expansion) and Unit 01`s progressive knife.</description>

<description>The ninth Angel, Matariel, has the appearance of a massive opilionid-like creature with numerous eyes. The central eye on the underbelly secretes a strong solvent which can easily melt through both concrete and steel. The Angel attempts to burn a tunnel directly into the Geofront using the solvent. The Angel appears to possess no armament beyond this solvent, and its AT-Field never physically manifests, though the battle plan against it made mention of using Unit 02 to nullify its AT field before it would be fired upon. Matariel`s core is not revealed.
Matariel emerged from the ocean during a near-total power outage in Tokyo-3 (caused by an unnamed individual or party). It was defeated through the coordinated efforts of Units 00, 01, and 02, in the first simultaneous deployment of all three Evas. Due to the power outage, the Evas ran on their internal batteries, supplemented by large additional batteries mounted to the shoulder boxes, and had to be launched manually. The Angel was killed using standard-issue Eva firearms, the only successful attempt at doing so.</description>

<name>Sahaquiel</name>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The tenth Angel, Sahaquiel, is a massive and bizarrely-shaped creature. It has an elongated body, with three eye-like markings (one in the centre and one on either end of the body), and three stem-like growths projecting radially at both ends. Sahaquiel`s AT field is comparatively powerful, able to shield the Angel from several dozen N² bombs. It also seems to have an ability to jam satellite communications. The Angel`s most devastating weapon is itself: utilizing both kinetic energy and its AT field, it drops pieces of itself onto Earth as bombs. Its core appears as the pupil of the central "eye."
Sahaquiel first appeared in low-earth orbit. The Angel`s jamming ability prevented Nerv HQ from contacting Commander Ikari or Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki in Antarctica. When Nerv attempted to analyze the Angel, it crushed the scanning satellites with its AT field (although they were able to complete the scan). Attempts to destroy the Angel using N² bombs utterly failed. The Angel began dropping pieces of itself onto Earth. The first hit landed in the middle of the Pacific Ocean (far from Tokyo-3) but with each successive hit the Angel`s aim improved. For the final blow, the attack that would land on Nerv proper, Sahaquiel intended to drop its entire body onto Tokyo-3. The resulting blast would have been so powerful that Tokyo-3 would have been transformed into an extension of the Pacific Ocean.
Sahaquiel was intercepted and killed through the combined efforts of all three Evas. They first stopped the Angel`s physical descent and canceled out its AT field, negating both of its main means of attack, then killed the Angel by stabbing its core with a prog knife.</description>

<name>Leliel</name>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The twelfth Angel, Leliel, has a misleading appearance and possesses bizarre properties and powers. The Angel initially appears as a large, floating, black-and-white patterned sphere, and, when attacked, it re-manifests as a large black shadow. The Angel`s true body is the shadow itself, and the "shadow" of the Angel is the floating sphere, this makes this Angel one of the most difficult to combat as it is impossible to attack a virtually 2-D creature. Leliel is explained as possessing an inverted AT field, which allows the Angel to take into itself anything in range of its shadow-like body, but keeping it contained. (An analogy would be a two-way mirror.) Within the inverted AT field is a Dirac sea, which "could lead to another universe." At its fullest extension, the Angel`s body is 600 metres in diameter and 3 nanometres thick. It is unknown whether Leliel had a core.
Leliel appeared (literally out of thin air) over Tokyo-3, and all three Evas were sortied against it. Shinji, in Unit 01, impulsively fired upon the Angel"s spherical "body", which vanished before his shots hit it. Immediately after the "body" disappeared, a shadow appeared under Unit 01`s feet, absorbing both the Eva and a substantial portion of Tokyo-3. Unit 01 was cut off from all power and communication. Once Nerv realized the properties of the Angel, in order to kill it they planned to drop the 992 remaining N² bombs into the Angel while Units 00 and 02 negated its AT field, in spite of the possibility of losing Shinji in process. Within the Angel, Shinji experienced a bizarre sort of self-psychoanalysis (speculated by Seele to be an attempt by the Angel to establish contact with a human). Moments before dropping the N² mines into Leliel, Unit 01, out of battery power at this point, activated berserker mode and tore its way out of the spherical shadow, shattering its 2-dimensional body. The spherical shadow released torrents of blood as Unit 01 emerged.</description>

<name>Bardiel</name>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The thirteenth Angel, Bardiel, inhabits Unit 03. It apparently possesses all the properties and strengths of Unit 03, and it can also stretch the Eva`s arms to a distance roughly equal to the Eva`s height. The Angel`s core is never shown, but, given that it has taken over Unit 03, and the Evangelions all have cores, it can be assumed to possess Unit 03`s core.
Bardiel initially appeared in a cloud, infecting Unit 03 as it passed through in the process of being transported from the USA to Japan. The Angel revealed itself during the activation test at the Matsushiro facility, at the instant the "Absolute Borderline" (the point in startup where a pilot interfaces with an Eva) was reached. Despite a quick cutoff of the external power cable, the Angel apparently had generated an S² engine capable of powering Unit 03, completely taking over the Eva and destroying the base in a huge detonation detected back at Nerv HQ. Responding to the explosion and detection of an unidentified object, Nerv sortied all three Evas against it. Seeing that the Angel was an Eva, the pilots hesitated. Bardiel defeated Asuka in Unit 02 almost immediately. Rei, considering the pilot inside the possessed Eva, did not respond to orders to attack fast enough, and was attacked and disabled by the Angel, which attempted to "fuse" with Unit 00. Commander Ikari ordered the infected portion of her Eva cut off, throwing Bardiel away in the explosion and paralysing Rei`s left arm. The Angel then focused on Shinji. During the assault, Shinji was able to see that the Eva`s entry plug was still inside the Angel. Even as Bardiel attacked Unit 01, using its extendable arms for the first time, Shinji refused to fight back, refusing to harm the trapped Eva pilot. Commander Ikari ordered Shinji cut off from Unit 01 and the Dummy Plug system to be activated. Under the Dummy Plug`s control, Unit 01 broke Bardiel`s neck and literally tore the Eva to shreds, only stopping once Unit 03`s entry plug—with Suzuhara Touji inside it—was crushed.
Seele specifically mentions the thirteenth Angel during their interrogation of Misato regarding the twelfth Angel. No reasons are given in the series for this mention. However, the twelfth, thirteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth angels all contacted an EVA.</description>

<name>Zeruel</name>
<gender>unknown</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>The fourteenth Angel, Zeruel, appears as a floating creature as large as the Evas but lacking humanoid limbs, with a malformed "skull" as a face. Zeruel possesses the most powerful Angel beam attack to date (which, like Sachiel`s, detonates into the shape of a Christian cross) which it can fire several times in rapid succession, it also possesses folding foil-like "arms" that it uses as cutting weapons in close-range combat, the "arms" can breach most materials with relative ease. It also uses these "arms" to crawl about when it breaks into Central Dogma from the Geo Front. The Angel has a relatively powerful AT field, and its armor-like "skin" is strong enough to endure the point-blank detonation of an N² bomb completely undamaged even without the usage of an AT field. All in all, Zeruel is one of the most powerful Angels ever seen. Its core is located on its chest.
Zeruel initially appeared and proceeded to the GeoFront, and, in a demonstration of power, blasted through 18 layers of the GeoFront`s armour with a single shot of its beam attack. Inside the GeoFront, the Angel was confronted first by Asuka in Unit 02. Unit 02`s artillery attacks were completely ineffective, and, using its foil-like arms, Zeruel cut off the Eva`s arms and decapitated it. Rei in Unit 00 (which was still damaged from the battle with Bardiel) attempted to stop Zeruel in a kamikaze attack with an N² bomb, but after Unit 00 successfully pushed through the Angel`s AT field, Zeruel covered its core with a protective membrane which the mine failed to penetrate. Zeruel disabled Unit 00 and proceeded to blast through and enter Central Dogma proper (the only Angel to do so from outside the GeoFront by force). Seconds before wiping out the bridge (and everyone in it), the Angel was confronted by Shinji in Unit 01.
During the fight, Zeruel blew off Unit 01`s left arm, but Shinji still managed to force the Angel onto an Eva launch platform and launch both of them outside of Central Dogma. Unit 01 battered the Angel before attempting to rip off its head but Unit 01`s battery power ran out before Shinji could defeat the Angel. Zeruel, now unhindered, destroyed the Eva`s chest armor, revealing Unit 01`s core, which the Angel tried to break with its arms. Before it could land the final blow, Unit 01 went berserk (in the series, the rhythmic beating against the Eva`s core is what revives Unit 01, creating the sound of a heartbeat in the entry plug). The Eva stopped Zeruel`s right arm as it attempted to strike again, splitting it apart, then forcefully pulled Zeruel toward it, impaling the Angel`s right eye on its distinctive forehead protrusion. Unit 01 then kicked the Angel away, tearing the arm off and converting it into a new left arm for itself. The Angel then attacked Unit 01 with its remaining arm, which was destroyed by Unit 01`s AT-Field, causing the sharp fragments to rebound and severely wound the Angel. Unit 01 then smashed the Angel`s face into the ground when it attempted to fire a final beam at it. Unit 01 finished off the crippled Angel and devoured it, ingesting the Angel`s S² engine. During the battle, Unit 01 breaks free of its armour.</description>

<description>Unit 00 is the Prototype, the first successful Evangelion, and is piloted by the First Child, Ayanami Rei. The head design is similar to that of the previous failed attempts, but with only one eye. There are two domes on the top of the head, one white and one transparent green; their function (if any) is never revealed. Unit 00 is the only one of the original Evas that is never seen without its armour (Unit 02 was revealed in End of Evangelion, and Unit 01 on multiple occasions) or opening its mouth; thus the appearance of its organic body is unknown.
Unit 00 was initially coloured orange like the previous prototypes, but its armour was damaged beyond repair by the Angel Ramiel`s particle beam. The subsequent repairs and upgrades included blue armour plating in addition to other alterations made in order to make it more suitable for combat conditions. The upgrades to Unit 00`s armour make it look more like the subsequent Evas, but there are still several differences or actual limitations. Shoulder "blades" are added to the Unit`s armour; though similar in appearance to the ones on Units 01 and 02, they are used to hold retro-rockets, as seen in the fight with the ninth Angel, Matariel. Because it is only the prototype, Unit 00 cannot be fitted with D-type equipment. The true nature of the soul inside Unit 00 is never specified, but it is implied to be directly connected to Rei in some fashion.
Unit 00 was self-destructed by Rei in order to destroy the sixteenth Angel, Armisael.</description>

<description>Created in the Third Annex of Gehirn`s Artificial Evolution Laboratory in Hakone from 2003 to 2004 and deemed a functional Eva unit in 2014, Unit 01 is piloted by Shinji Ikari (with Rei or a Rei Dummy Plug as backup pilots), and has the best battle record of all the Evangelions. It frequently acts independently (the "berserker" mode), without the instructions of a pilot and without any apparent power source. The Eva will also take action to protect its pilot while sometimes servicing other interests. The Eva`s resident soul, Ikari Yui (Shinji`s mother), appears to be responsible for such events. Unit 01 is called the "Test Type," perhaps because of the experimental way in which it was created: although Unit 01 seems to be an Adam-derived cybernetic organism like all other Evangelions, it is the sole Eva to have been born from Lilith.
Upon savagely disfiguring the fourteenth angel, Zeruel, it proceeded to devour the Angel and assimilated its S² Engine, making Unit 01 the first physically complete Evangelion prior to the construction of the Mass Production units. The S² Engine seems to be used only at Unit 01`s discretion; after acquiring it, the Eva is still sent into battle with an umbilical cable. Just before Unit 01 absorbed the S² Engine, it used one of Zeruel`s arms to regenerate its severed left arm, demonstrating the Angelic ability of regeneration. The Mass Production models were also equipped with Nerv-developed S² Engines but it is a common misconception that they also have the ability to regenerate.
Unit 01`s armour is primarily purple; some components are coloured neon green, light blue, orange, and black. The helmet, with its prominent horn and "frill," is vaguely evocative of a ceratopsid dinosaur. The pectoral plates are different from those seen on any other Eva. The humanoid entity beneath the armour has light brown skin, two emerald-green eyes, four small nostrils positioned preorbitally, and red blood.
As a result of Third Impact, at the conclusion of The End of Evangelion, Unit 01 is left floating adrift in space, fossilised and still containing the soul of Ikari Yui, where it will outlast the sun and moon, as an eternal testament that the human race existed.</description>

<description>Evangelion Unit 02, built by Nerv Germany, is the first Production Model Eva. It is piloted by Souryuu Asuka Langley and is the first Evangelion built specifically for combat. The Eva`s armour is primarily red with yellow and white on the arms and head. The head armour has two movable sections, one covering both the jaw and lower eyes and the other above the upper pair of eyes. These plates are hinged and can shift, displaying the Eva`s eyes underneath. This is first seen underwater during the fight with Gaghiel. As a result of being constructed by Nerv Germany, and also as an accommodation for its three-quarters-German pilot, its default language setting is German. Unit 02 features a different progressive knife from earlier Eva units as well as an internal weapon rack in the right shoulder binder which fires dartlike weapons.
Unlike Unit 01, it only goes truly "berserk" once, just before its destruction. It has achieved an unusually high sync ratio with its pilot(s), on two other occasions: once in combat against the 6th angel Gaghiel, and once under the influence of the 17th Angel. It is known to contain the maternal part of the soul of Asuka`s mother.
Unit 02 has blue blood, which is first seen when the fourteenth Angel, Zeruel, cuts off its arms. It has brown skin and four orange eyes, first seen when the MP Evas tear it apart.</description>

<description>The first Angel is Adam. It appeared just before Second Impact as a "giant of light" that resembles an Eva, and was also shown to have four wings (shown separately). All of the other Angels (apart from Lilith, Adam`s "equal") are descended from Adam, although it is not made clear whether this is in a biological sense or a metaphysical sense. Adam`s descendants possess the "Fruit of Life," the source of the Angels` power and immortality (also known as the S² Engine).
Adam was discovered in the White Moon, buried under Antarctica. The Katsuragi Expedition attempted a "contact experiment" with Adam using the Lance of Longinus, which went out of control and triggered Second Impact. Adam`s body was reduced to an embryonic form, and its soul was resurrected into Kaworu Nagisa. Adam`s body was later retrieved and used as the basis for the Evangelions, with the exception of Unit 01.
Later, Ryoji Kaji delivered Adam, encased in dura-bakelite, to Nerv commander Gendou Ikari, who at an unspecified later time had Adam grafted to his right palm. The series did not reveal what purpose this served, but in End of Evangelion, Gendou tried to physically merge Rei with Adam by pushing his right hand into her body.</description>

<description>The second Angel is Lilith (Though technically also the first human, due to the GeoFront in which Lilith resides is supposed to be the birthplace of all humans, and the GeoFront where Adam was located is the birthplace all Angels.). Lilith initially appears as a white, legless giant, whose face is covered with a mask displaying the logo of Seele. Numerous human-like legs protrude from its legless stumps. The Angel is crucified on a giant cross-like restraint in Terminal Dogma, the deepest level of Nerv headquarters. Lilith`s torso constantly leaks LCL from an unseen wound, forming a lake of LCL at the base of its restraint which is tapped to fill the Evas` entry plugs.
In First Impact, Lilith usurped Adam as the progenitor of life on Earth. All life on Earth is supposedly descended from this Angel, although it is never specified if this is in a biological sense or a metaphysical sense. Lilith`s descendants possess the "Fruit of Wisdom," the source of human science and technology. The "Deleted Scenes" from episode 23 also reveal that Unit 01 is artificially derived from Lilith.
Lilith was discovered in the Black Moon, underneath Japan. The Black Moon was converted into the GeoFront, and the site of Lilith`s body became Terminal Dogma. It is never stated whether Lilith was already crucified when it was found, or whether it was later crucified. At some point after Ikari Yui`s contact experiment with Unit 01, Lilith`s soul was placed into Ayanami Rei. Later, once it was retrieved, the Lance of Longinus was used to impale the Angel. When Kaji revealed Lilith to Katsuragi Misato, both assumed it was Adam. Tabris later properly identified it as Lilith. The series does not explicitly reveal Lilith`s exact role in the plans for Instrumentality.
In The End of Evangelion, Ikari Gendou tried to initiate his version of Instrumentality by pushing his right hand (to which had been grafted the embryonic body of the Angel Adam) into Rei`s body. Rei, however, absorbed Adam (along with most of Gendou`s arm) into herself, rejected Gendou`s control of her, and merged with Lilith on her own. Though Rei merged with Lilith, she took Lilith into the form of Rei for most of The End of Evangelion. The merged Rei/Lilith freed itself from its bonds and transformed into a colossal winged version of Rei. It then generated an anti-AT field which covered the entire planet, nullifying the AT fields of every human and reverting humanity back into the primordial soup. Rei/Lilith died when Shinji rejected Instrumentality.</description>

It consists of at least twelve prominent people; five of them form the Instrumentality Committee, which directly oversees Nerv`s progress, officially in the name of the UN. Its members are referred to as the "Old Men."
Seele is a secret organisation, the real puppetmasters behind the United Nations. Its origins are shrouded in mystery; they would claim to have existed since ancient times, functioning as an Illuminati-like power cabal over most of the world`s governments. This cannot be verified, but they have been operating since at least soon after World War II, when they acquired the secret sections of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The secret Dead Sea Scrolls predicted the arrival of the Angels and of Third Impact, and Seele began striving to develop means to defeat the Angels so that a human-centred Instrumentality process would proceed. Having decided that humanity as a whole had reached an evolutionary dead end, Seele seeks to bring about Instrumentality and unite all humans into one hyper-being, the next stage of existence.
In German "Seele" means "soul".</description>

<description>Nerv`s predecessor located inside the GeoFront and tasked with research and development of the Evangelion units and the Magi, amongst other things. Branch 3 is located in Germany. Two other branches are located in the USA, and one probably in China. A minor branch is located in Matsushiro, Japan. Many of its facilities and members (including prominently Ikari Gendou, Ikari Yui, Fuyutsuki Kouzou, Soryu Zeppelin Kyouko and Akagi Ritsuko) would become Nerv personnel later. It was converted into Nerv shortly after Akagi Naoko`s death and the MAGI were developed and made operational. The main characters would later see a "graveyard" filled with Gehirn`s failed Evangelion prototypes, of which line of research Unit 00 and later Evangelions would be made.</description>

<description>The eleventh Angel, Iruel, is a nano-scale entity, similar to a virus. In addition to its AT field, it demonstrates an ability to adapt and evolve to almost anything. Rather than "moving" in the conventional sense, the Angel seems to simply spread by rapidly reproducing at the cellular level. It is not known whether or not Iruel has a core.
It appears in the Pribnow Box deep in the GeoFront, where it is initially mistaken for corrosion before spreading to where the pilots are taking part in tests. Ritsuko and Misato, prior to understanding what they were up against, attempted to destroy the "corrosion" with lasers, only to have an AT field materialise to block their efforts. They soon discovered that the Angel is vulnerable to ozone and so pumped large amounts of it into the area of infection. The tactic temporarily stopped the Angel`s spread, but after only a few seconds, it adapted to the ozone, and even absorbed it to increase its strength before suddenly mutating into a form resembling electronic circuitry. Linked into the Pribnow box computer systems, the Angel electronically hacked into the MAGI computer systems, protecting the hard connections with an AT field on the cables to prevent it from being cut off. While inside, it read many critical files and initiated a self-destruct sequence before being slowed down long enough by Ritsuko to allow her in turn to initiate the Angel`s destruction by using the last "free" MAGI to set the Angel on an evolutionary path to its own annihilation.</description>

<name>Nagisa Kaworu</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Tabris, the seventeenth and final Angel, holds the form of a human, Kaworu Nagisa. Like the other Angels, he is "born of Adam", although it is implied that he was created by Seele. He contains the soul of Adam, similar to how Rei contains the soul of Lilith. Tabris` AT field is the most powerful ever detected, strong enough to block out "light, magnetism, sub-atomic particles, everything". He may control any Evangelion unit he wishes, even from outside the entry plug, so long as the soul inhabiting the Eva is dormant. Within the entry plug, he can set his synchronization ratio at any level he wishes. The nature or even the very existence of his core is not revealed.
Tabris, as Kaworu, infiltrated Nerv under the pretense of being sent to replace Asuka as Unit 02`s pilot. During his stay in Tokyo-3, he formed an extremely close relationship with Shinji. Kaworu later revealed himself as an Angel, seizing control of Unit 02 and descending with it towards Terminal Dogma. Shinji, in Unit 01, was sent to stop him, but was forced to battle Unit 02 while Tabris proceeded to Terminal Dogma. Tabris` AT field manifested during the battle, effectively cutting both of them off from all contact with anyone outside. After he reached Terminal Dogma, Tabris was surprised to discover that the Angel held there was not Adam, but Lilith. Shinji incapacitated Unit 02 and proceeded to try to stop the Angel. Tabris, gripped in Unit 01`s hand, stated his unwillingness to destroy mankind by causing Third Impact, and asked Shinji to kill him. Shinji, after a long period of hesitation, crushed the Angel in his Eva`s hand.</description>

<description>Pen Pen (often styled as Pen²) is a "hot spring penguin" and Misato`s pet. He lives in a custom refrigerator in Misato`s apartment, enjoys taking warm baths, eating whatever food he can get his hands (or wings) on, and going to hot springs. He also appears to have a relatively high degree of intelligence, as he is also shown watching TV and reading newspapers. He is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara in the Japanese series. He is the result of a genetics experiment at Misato`s former workplace, and she adopted him after the experiment`s conclusion rather than let him be euthanised. His wingtips have retractable claws, which normal birds do not have.</description>

<description>Toji is a tough boy, the stereotypical "jock," as evidenced by the fact that he is the only student in Shinji`s class that refuses to wear the school uniform (although he does actually wear it once, in the ninth episode). Toji is good friends with Kensuke Aida, and is in constant conflict with Asuka. Toji`s younger sister was injured in the battle between Sachiel and Unit 01, and after learning that Shinji was Unit 01`s pilot, he beats Shinji up as payback. However, after witnessing firsthand the suffering Shinji experiences piloting Unit 01 in the battle against Shamshel, Toji comes to respect Shinji and the two become friends.
Unbeknownst to Toji for much of the series, his normally by-the-book class rep Hikari Horaki actually has a crush on him, which she tries to repress and disguise by bossing him around. Later in the series, she begins bringing especially big homemade lunches to school for Toji, since he loves to eat ("Toji the Stomach," as Kensuke refers to him). Subsequently, her feelings begin to come to the forefront and Toji seems to return her affection.
Toji is eventually selected to be the Fourth Child, and agrees on the condition that his sister be moved to Nerv`s medical facilities. En route to the testing facility, Unit 03 is taken over by Bardiel. When Toji is inserted in the entry plug and the Eva is powered up, Bardiel takes over and the Eva goes on a rampage. All the other Evas are deployed to stop Unit 03, but Units 00 and 02 are quickly defeated, and Shinji refuses orders to destroy Unit 03, wanting to try to save the pilot. However, Gendo orders that Unit 01`s Dummy Plug system be activated, overriding Shinji`s control. Unit 01 proceeds to tear Unit 03 to shreds and crush its entry plug. After the battle, Shinji learns that Toji is the pilot as the wreckage of the entry plug is examined. Toji survives but is critically injured, losing his left leg. Along with Kensuke and the rest of his class, he is eventually evacuated from Tokyo-3; what happens to him after that is unknown. He appears at the end of episode 26 in Shinji`s subconscious.</description>

<description>Built in the United States by Nerv Second Branch in Massachusetts, USA, Evangelion Unit 03 is one of two Units built with the Second Production Model design. It is the brother Unit of Unit 04 (Unit 3 and Unit 4 were oddly the only Evangelion who were addressed as males during the series). The United States government insisted on having the rights to build Unit 03 and Unit 04. A few minor changes were made between the first and second Production Models. Unit 03`s color was unique, with much darker plates than any other Eva. The head was oddly shaped, too, with a rounded top and exaggerated chin.
The pilot assigned to it was Toji Suzuhara, but in transit to Japan, it was possessed by the thirteenth Angel, Bardiel, which appeared as a cloud. As Bardiel, it was savagely torn apart by Unit 01, after the control of Unit 01 was switched from Shinji to the Dummy Plug system, designed to simulate Rei Ayanami as the pilot. Toji, the pilot, was severely injured.</description>

<name>Kaji Ryouji</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Kaji Ryouji is employed by Nerv as a special inspector. He wears a ponytail, has a constant 5 o`clock-shadow, and is always referred to by his surname.
Kaji appears to be a triple agent, working as a special inspector for Nerv, while secretly investigating the organisation for the Japanese Ministry of the Interior, and at times seemingly acting as a cat`s paw both for and against Ikari Gendou and Seele. In addition, he seems to maintain personal motivations beyond loyalty to any organisation, and speaks frequently of his desire to "find the truth." Kaji can be said to have a green thumb, as he cultivates a watermelon patch close to Nerv HQ. (This is only seen in the anime; he is watering the watermelons while Zeruel is attacking the GeoFront.)
Kaji and Katsuragi Misato were lovers during college, but had long since broken up by the start of the series and do not see each other again until she flies out to the UN fleet ferrying Unit 02 and Souryuu Asuka Langley to Japan. After he returns to Nerv headquarters, Kaji and Misato flirt and fight, Kaji teasing Misato, and Misato constantly calling him "stupid." However, they rekindle their romance after Misato confesses that she broke up with him because Kaji reminded her too much of her father.
Most of the time, Kaji is very easygoing and jovial, always remaining cool and composed and maintaining his detached sense of humour even during times of crisis. He also flirts unabashedly with his female peers and co-workers, which further draws Misato`s ire. Despite his irresponsible public persona, Kaji demonstrates a great level of personal responsibility and worldly wisdom in his personal interactions. He acts as something of a father figure to both Asuka and Shinji, particularly the latter. Asuka is openly infatuated with him, something he coolly and repeatedly deflects. He offers Shinji contemplative advice and tries to help him understand the nature of social dynamics. Behind all of this, however, Kaji hints at being a very melancholic and lonely individual, plagued by doubts of his own sincerity and whether he is capable of true love.
Kaji is ordered by Seele to kidnap Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki Kouzou so that he can be interrogated. Kaji follows his orders, but disobeys Seele by rescuing Fuyutsuki later and returning him to Nerv. Prior to this, he remarks that his Nerv I.D. card is the colour of blood; also, during their last meeting, Kaji gives Misato a small capsule which contains the information for the Human Instrumentality Project, then says "This may be the last gift I give you." He then leaves Misato a farewell phone message, indicating that he knew he would likely be dead when she heard it. Fuyutsuki even remarks that his actions will cost him his life. Kaji is eventually shot and killed by an unknown assailant.</description>

<charactertype id="2">Mecha</charactertype>
<description>Unit 00 is the Prototype, the first successful Evangelion, and is piloted by the First Child, Ayanami Rei. The head design is similar to that of the previous failed attempts, but with only one eye. There are two domes on the top of the head, one white and one transparent green; their function (if any) is never revealed. Unit 00 is the only one of the original Evas that is never seen without its armour (Unit 02 was revealed in End of Evangelion, and Unit 01 on multiple occasions) or opening its mouth; thus the appearance of its organic body is unknown.
Unit 00 was initially coloured orange like the previous prototypes, but its armour was damaged beyond repair by the Angel Ramiel`s particle beam. The subsequent repairs and upgrades included blue armour plating in addition to other alterations made in order to make it more suitable for combat conditions. The upgrades to Unit 00`s armour make it look more like the subsequent Evas, but there are still several differences or actual limitations. Shoulder "blades" are added to the Unit`s armour; though similar in appearance to the ones on Units 01 and 02, they are used to hold retro-rockets, as seen in the fight with the ninth Angel, Matariel. Because it is only the prototype, Unit 00 cannot be fitted with D-type equipment. The true nature of the soul inside Unit 00 is never specified, but it is implied to be directly connected to Rei in some fashion.
Unit 00 was self-destructed by Rei in order to destroy the sixteenth Angel, Armisael.</description>

<description>Nerv`s Deputy Commander and Ikari Gendou`s right hand man. He does not especially like Gendou, but he is the closest thing to a confidant that Gendou has in the series.
Once a professor of meta-biology at Kyoto University, Fuyutsuki became interested in the research and theories undertaken by Ikari Yui, and became her sponsor and mentor. Shortly thereafter, he was directed by his superiors to initiate a similar arrangement with Rokobungi Gendou.
Later, after the Second Impact, Fuyutsuki travelled with Gendou to the ruins of Antarctica, and began to suspect that Gendou and his associates in Seele were more powerful and dangerous than he originally realized. In 2003, Fuyutsuki discovered for himself the true nature of the events leading up to Second Impact and Seele`s involvement in initiating that catastrophe. Gendou led him into the GeoFront and Central Dogma, and asked Fuyutsuki to join him in "creating a new future for mankind."</description>

His hobbies include camping in the mountains surrounding Tokyo-3 and playing at simulated war re-enacting - by himself. Kensuke solidifies his friendship with Shinji after Shinji saves him and Toji during the fight against the fourth Angel, Shamshel. Kensuke dreams of becoming an Eva pilot and ceaselessly begs Shinji to pull strings in Nerv so he can be selected as a pilot, despite Shinji telling him that he has no say in the matter. He also seems oblivious to the intense physical and psychological distress endured by Eva pilots. Nevertheless, Kensuke enjoys the privileges of being the friend of an Eva pilot. Like Touji, Kensuke has a crush on Katsuragi Misato.</description>

<charactertype id="3">Organization</charactertype>
<description>The world intergovernmental organisation which funds Nerv. Due to the Second Impact followed by series of warfare, the U.N. was heavily funded by superpowers (such as the United States and China) and other powerful organisations (like Seele), enabling it to mobilise a powerful military. The U.N. armed forces are made up of units from member nations, such as Japan`s JSSDF.
Many traditional air force units are replaced with VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) fighters and bombers. The naval power of the U.N. is primarily made up of a mix of many different types of ships from many navies. The U.N. Pacific Fleet operates Iowa class battleships (United States Navy), Arleigh Burke class destroyers (United States Navy), Udaloy class destroyers (Russian Navy), Ticonderoga class cruisers (United States Navy), Admiral Kuznetsov class aircraft carriers (Russian Navy), and several United States Navy aircraft carriers, specifically the flagship of the fleet, the Nimitz class carrier USS Harry S. Truman (renamed Over the Rainbow in the anime). The U.N. aircraft carriers, such as Over the Rainbow, also carry a mix of both Russian and American naval aircraft, such as Sukhoi Su-33 fighters, Yakovlev Yak-38 VTOL fighters, EA-6 Prowler electronic warfare craft, and E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning craft. It is a strong possibility that the United Nations possesses N² bombs as well as traditional stealth planes. Much of the U.N. forces remain unknown, but it is clear that their military reforms are significant.
Unlike Nerv and Seele, the United Nations still relies on a traditional military with conventional weapons.</description>

<description>She was a student of genetic engineering at Kyoto University, where she met Fuyutsuki, who took an interest in her research and would later become a mentor and trusted friend, as well as her future husband Gendo. Afterwards, she joined the Artificial Evolution Laboratory (which would become Gehirn) in Hakone, Japan, and played an integral role in Project E.
Despite Fuyutsuki`s misgivings, Yui served as the test subject for the Contact Experiment of Unit 01 in 2004, saying that "everything happens as it must." She invited her son Shinji to Gehirn to watch what would be her final moments: Yui "disappeared" during testing — leaving no body behind — and was proclaimed dead that same year after efforts to recover her failed. Although Gehirn considered it an accident, it is arguably clear that what happened was Yui`s intention. Living on as the soul of the Eva, she continues to ensure a "bright future" for Shinji and the rest of humanity, seeing to it personally that Seele`s scenario is never entirely fulfilled.</description>

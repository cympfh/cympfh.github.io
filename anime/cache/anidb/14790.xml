<description>* A movie project to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Ojamajo Doremi franchise.
27-year-old Tokyo office worker Yoshizuki Mire just returned to Japan, while 22-year-old fourth-year college student Nagase Sora aspires to be a teacher, and 20-year-old boyish Kawatani Reika is a part-time Hiroshima okonomiyaki shop worker and freelancer. What draws together these three women from completely different walks of life is a magic gem. A "New Magical Story" begins when they are mysteriously brought together by chance and embark on a journey.

<name>Harukaze Doremi</name>
<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Harukaze Doremi is the protagonist. Doremi reflects a typical mahou shoujo: lively to the point of being noisy, a poor student, clumsy and careless but very compassionate, and has shown to be boy-crazy in earlier seasons. Her favorite food is steak (which she is unable to obtain throughout the entire series). She proclaims herself to be "the unluckiest pretty girl in the whole world." Her name is a play on the first 3 notes of the musical scale DoReMi. Her fairy is Dodo, and is very much like Doremi.</description>

<description>Fujiwara Hazuki is a friend of Doremi since kindergarten, is a shy, passive and sweet girl. Hazuki cares about her family very much, especially her mother; she did not really like the dresses she got from her mother, but would do everything that she was asked to do. Hazuki has a large fear of ghosts and tries to counter it with thoughts of Majo Rika; this seldom works. In the end, she chose a specially reputated secondary school rather than staying with Doremi. Her fairy is Rere.</description>
